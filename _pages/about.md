I am a Ph.D. student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, advised by Prof. Daqing Zhang. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, China.


Research Interests
======
I am interested in wireless sensing and mobile computing. My recent research focuses on LoRa-based sensing, including human vital sensing and soil moisture sensing.
