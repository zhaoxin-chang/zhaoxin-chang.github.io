About Me
======
I am a Ph.D. student at Institut Polytechnique de Paris, advised by Prof. [Daqing Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=en&user=qn8CqEYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University in 2020.


Research Interests
======
I am interested in wireless sensing and mobile computing. My recent research focuses on LoRa-based sensing, including human vital sign sensing and soil moisture sensing.
